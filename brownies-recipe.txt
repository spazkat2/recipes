   Quick and Easy Fudge Brownies

Ingredients
    1 cup King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour or Measure for Measure Gluten-Free Flour
    3/4 cup natural cocoa, Dutch-process cocoa, or Triple Cocoa Blend
    2 cups sugar
    1/4 teaspoon salt*
    1/4 teaspoon baking powder
    1 teaspoon espresso powder, optional; for enhanced chocolate flavor
    3 large eggs
    1/2 cup (8 tablespoons) butter, melted
    1/4 cup vegetable oil
    2 teaspoons vanilla extract
    *Increase the salt to 1/2 teaspoon if you use unsalted butter.

Instructions

    Preheat the oven to 375Â°F. Lightly grease a 9" x 13" pan.
    Put all of the ingredients into a large bowl in the order in which they're written. Stir, then beat the mixture until it's smooth.
    Spoon the batter into the prepared pan.
    Bake the brownies for 25 to 30 minutes, or until they're just barely beginning to pull away from the sides of the pan.
    Remove the brownies from the oven; let them cool completely before cutting. Store any leftovers, well-wrapped, at room temperature for 5 to 6 days. Freeze for longer storage.
